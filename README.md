This plugin uses JavaScript and NPM.

First, download Node.js which comes with NPM. This will allow you to install dependencies.
You can find the download link here:

  https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Next, in the directory of your plugin, install the dependencies by running:

  npm install

That's it! You can now edit `code.js` directly and it will work in Figma. No compilation step is needed.
